            <h3> About the Photel</h3>
            <p>
                   A hotel is an establishment that provides paid lodging on a short-term basis. Facilities provided 
                   inside a hotel room may range from a modest-quality mattress in a small room to large suites with bigger, 
                   higher-quality beds, a dresser, a refrigerator, and other kitchen facilities, upholstered chairs, 
                   a television, and en-suite bathrooms. Small, lower-priced hotels may offer only the most basic guest 
                   services and facilities. Larger, higher-priced hotels may provide additional guest facilities such as a 
                   swimming pool, a business center with computers, printers, and other office equipment, childcare, conference 
                   and event facilities, tennis or basketball courts, gymnasium, restaurants, day spa, and social function 
                   services. Hotel rooms are usually numbered (or named in some smaller hotels and B&Bs) to allow guests to 
                   identify their room. Some boutique, high-end hotels have custom decorated rooms. Some hotels offer meals 
                   as part of a room and board arrangement. In Japan, capsule hotels provide a tiny room suitable only for 
                   sleeping and shared bathroom facilities.
